# ChessTimer

## Overview

ChessClock is a simple and hobbyist Android application built using Jetpack Compose that functions as a digital chess clock. The screen is divided into two equal sections, each representing a player's timer. Players can tap on their respective halves of the screen to pause their timer and start the other player's timer. The app is designed for chess players who need a quick and straightforward way to manage game time.
This application was created as a fun, personal project to explore the features of Jetpack Compose and to provide a minimalistic tool for chess enthusiasts.
